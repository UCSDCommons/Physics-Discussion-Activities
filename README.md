# Physics-Discussion-Activities
Collection of short activities/lessons to be used in introductory physics discussion sections.

Welcome to the (hopefully growing) collection of UC San Diego physics discussion section lessons! The purpose of this repository is to provide 1 page activities/lessons for teaching assistants to do as part of the discussion section planning for the 1, 2, and 4 series. These are designed to take 10 to 20 minutes each (time estimate is given in the actual plan document) and provide students a chance to work together and discuss the content of the class in order to solve a real-world problem.

There is a template file, Template.tex, that should be followed when designing a lesson to add to this repository.
